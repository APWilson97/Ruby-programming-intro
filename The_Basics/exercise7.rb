'The user was in the process of creating a hash but used a ) bracket instead of a curly } bracket at the end, which has led to the error in creating the hash. The ) was unexpected as hashes use {} brackets, hence the \'expecting\' part was expecting a } when the hash was being created.
The \'from\' part is tellin the user specifically where the error has occurred by giving the file path, which line inside of the file and under what element.'
